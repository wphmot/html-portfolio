<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I was born near Cleveland, Ohio, in 1967.  
    I moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1971 and 
    attended Greenway High School, graduating tied
    2nd in my class in 1985, and then Arizona State 
    University finally finishing my formative education in 1996.

    I have a BS in Computer Science (ASU 1991).

    I began my working career with Motorola in 1996
    as a software engineer.  I worked on various classified
    projects until Nokia Siemans Networks bought the unit
    I worked for in 2010 in the telecommunications area.  I shifted 
    into the testing area, having seen a need for a qualified 
    software engineer who knew the tremendous benefits of good automated testing 
    to the software development process and was soon promoted to test 
    manager.  I was highly successful at this, managing teams in 
    China and Poland.

    I was lucky enough to retire early in 2012.  But now I am looking to reenter
    the working world.
